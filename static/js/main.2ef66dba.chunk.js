What is the impact on you, your company, and the rest of the world as a result of material outsourcing? Before we dive into this, let me give you some historical perspective. After the end of the colonial period, many countries were left to adjust to newly formed governments to take the place of the colonial rulers. While these countries were no longer required to exchange materials with one another, the developing countries still needed to exchange goods with their previous rulers.

The first perspective we will explore is that of the Nationalist/Protectionist. As you may have already guessed, nationalists believe that globalization is bad. But, why? In the eyes of the Nationalist, any money spent or invested in foreign materials and foreign industry is money that could have been used to strengthen American industry and create jobs for Americans. Former president Trump was a big fan of this idea and often engaged in protectionism, which I will now explain. Protectionism is the process of protecting one's own industry by means of trade tariffs that lead to an overall decrease in imports (Trade, 2021). This will also lead to increased domestic production. which means that more jobs are created for Americans (Helper, 2012). According to many people, the US is currently losing a trade war to China due to our high import and low export situation.

It is obvious that the Globalist believes that globalization is a good thing for the world, but what makes them feel this way? The Globalist believes that trading materials around the world will lead to economic gains in a multitude of ways. Firstly, they believe that buying cheaper materials from another country will lead to cheaper consumer prices. This is expected to essentially raise the real wage of citizens in western countries by giving them more spending money that is saved due to low costs of goods. This is also expected to create more effective business models and increase business productivity (Erixon, 2018)."}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{style:{color:"#000",marginLeft:"10vw",paddingRight:"10vw",wordWrap:"break-word",textIndent:"20px",textAlign:"start"},children:"The final common perspective that people have in regards to outsourced materials is the sociologist/anthropologist perspective. Sociologists and anthropologists, while not disagreeing with the economic reasons, believe that globalization has negative consequences for economies and people around the world. One of the main sociological theories that backs this up is dependency theory. Dependency theory describes the current global market in terms of core (powerful) nations and peripheral (developing) nations.(Chase-Dunn, 2015). Chase-Dunn states that peripheral nations rely on these global trade agreements to maintain and slightly improve on their own economies. At the same time, the economic gains attained by the core nations that get cheaper production end up gaining significantly more from using these materials than the peripheral nations get from selling them. This is believed to lead to big increases in the wealth gap between core and peripheral nations, as well as creating a wealth gap between citizens in the peripheral nations. Sociologists also believe that increased factory creation in these areas, which is often done due to lack of pollution regulations, is severely damaging the environment and destroying the living spaces of many people."}),Object(u.jsx)("p",{style:{color:"#000",marginLeft:"10vw",paddingRight:"10vw",wordWrap:"break-word",textIndent:"20px",textAlign:"start"},children:"Now that you have some perspective on the various view points you may have already decided which ideation you align with the most.
